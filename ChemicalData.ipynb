The SELFIES grammar can be thought of as a elementary computer program that is transformed into a molecular graph with a simple compiler.\n",

After a ring and branch symbol, the subsequent symbol is interpreted as a number that stands for a length. This circumvents many syntactical issues with non-local features.\n",

        "Second, physical constraints are encoded by different states of the formal grammar. For example,a molecule of the form C=C=C is possible (three carbons connected via double bonds). However, F=O=F is not possible, because fluorine can only form one bond (not two) and oxygen can only form two bonds (not four as in this example). In SELFIES, after compiling a symbol into a part of the graph, the derivation state changes. This can be considered as a minimal memory that ensures the fulfilment of physical constraints.\n",
